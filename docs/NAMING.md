Want to rename stuff for tidiness

- use an id if its not a class / not being reused
- use exclusively semantic html
- use section / article with some consistency (are they all 'section's?)

class - 'weather-block' 

sidebar - aside

figure....

Is there a way to unit test this (either manually or automated?) - would be cool to learn! Also test using other accessibility tools (and chronicle?)

changed around commit 63/64 - as incorporating figure
