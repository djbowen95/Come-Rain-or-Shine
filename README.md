<h2 align="center"> Daily Weather Forecast. <i> Working towards Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>
<p><strong>Come Rain or Shine</strong> is a vibrant daily weather application that presents data drawn from the OpenWeather API in a responsive front-end. It is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am currently working on a major rebuild of the front-end of the website, as well as new documentation. The existing version of the project, which is functional but unstyled, is live deployed on GitHub pages: you can test it out [here](https://djbowen95.github.io/Come-Rain-or-Shine/).

I have wireframed a model for how I want the project to end up looking, which you can view [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e4LlRv6q2VT_CRc3AhTzguixGyE23NcCgGUtA1TYlc8/edit#slide=id.g18dede9af60_0_238).
